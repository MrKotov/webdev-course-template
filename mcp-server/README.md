# Exercise 1 · MCP server

Your hand-written MCP server lives in this folder. Write it in any language you like. The full task is on the exercise page; this file is the short version plus your notes.

## What is already here

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `lectures.json` | The course lectures. Your first tool reads this file. |
| `messages.jsonl` | The messages a client sends, in order, with what your server must answer. |
| `check.mjs` | The self-check. It starts your server, sends those messages and tells you what is wrong. |

## The two tools

1. **`find_lecture`** — everyone writes this one. Input: `number` (1 to 10). It returns the title and topics of that lecture from `lectures.json`. A number outside the range is not a crash and not a protocol error: it is a result with `isError: true` and a readable message.
2. **One of your own** — anything useful that reads local data. Give it a description a model can choose by.

## Run the self-check

```bash
node mcp-server/check.mjs -- <your start command>
# for example
node mcp-server/check.mjs -- node mcp-server/server.js
node mcp-server/check.mjs -- python3 mcp-server/server.py
```

It prints one line per check. Fix the failures yourself: the agent may explain a message or review your handler, but it must not write the protocol code for you.

## How to start it
<!-- The exact command, so the lecturer can run your server too. -->

## Session transcript
<!-- Paste one full session: initialize, the reply, tools/list, one good tools/call, one that fails. -->

## The description experiment
<!-- Three sentences: what you changed in the description, whether the model chose the tool differently, and why you think so. -->
